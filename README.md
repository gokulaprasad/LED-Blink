# LED-Blink
Description:
This file contains the Arduino sketch for controlling LEDs using a NodeMCU board and interfacing it with the Blynk mobile app. It establishes a connection to the Blynk server and listens for commands from the app to control the state and color of the LEDs connected to the NodeMCU.

Usage:
Upload this sketch to your NodeMCU board using the Arduino IDE or another compatible development environment. Ensure that the necessary libraries, including the Blynk library, are installed. After uploading, open the Blynk mobile app, configure it to connect to your NodeMCU device, and use the provided interface to send commands for LED control.

Dependencies:
Blynk library: This sketch depends on the Blynk library for establishing communication with the Blynk server and handling commands from the mobile app.


Contributing:
Contributions to this file should follow the coding conventions and formatting style consistent with the existing codebase. Ensure that any changes made maintain compatibility with the Blynk library and do not introduce regressions in functionality.
